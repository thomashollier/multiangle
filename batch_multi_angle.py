Qwen Image Edit — Multi-Angle Batch Renderer (ComfyUI API)
================================================================
Renders all 96 camera poses (8 azimuths × 4 elevations × 3 distances)
from a single input image. Supports both 2509 and 2511 pipelines.

Supports both LOCAL ComfyUI and COMFY CLOUD (cloud.comfy.org).

Requirements:
  pip install aiohttp   (only needed for --cloud mode)

Usage:
  # ── 2511 pipeline (default) ────────────────────────────────
  python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud

  # ── 2509 pipeline ──────────────────────────────────────────
  python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline 2509

  # ── SUBSET / DRY RUN ───────────────────────────────────────
