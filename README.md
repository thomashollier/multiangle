<h1 align="center">Character Soup to Character Nuts</h1>
<p align="center">AI assist for character assets from design sheets to rigged geometry</p>

A character sheet is the foundational document in any visual production pipeline. In animation, games, comics, and AI-driven content, it defines how a character looks from every angle, in every pose, and with every expression — the single source of truth that keeps a character consistent across hundreds of shots, scenes, or generated images.

This tool allows artists to iterate and experiment with their character designs in a more streamlined manner — generating up to 96 camera angles, 16 body poses, 16 facial expressions, lighting and outfit variations, and full skeleton extraction from a single reference image. The results still depend on artistic intent; careful prompting, thoughtful angle selection, and curation of the output are what make the difference.

The output is assembled into a PowerPoint presentation template.

Built on [Qwen Image Edit](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen-image-edit-682e380fc18bf79d426663a2) models running locally or on [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org) (requires API access token), with inline [DWPose](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux) skeleton extraction for downstream 3D and animation workflows.

The extracted 2D poses can then be lifted into 3D — see [3D Rig Generation](#3d-rig-generation) for the full image-to-rigged-mesh pipeline.

## Supported Pipelines

| Pipeline | LoRAs | Variations | Method |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **2511** (default) | [fal Multi-Angles](https://huggingface.co/fal/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Multiple-Angles-LoRA) | 96 (8 az x 4 el x 3 dist) | `QwenMultiangleCameraNode` |
| **2509** | [dx8152 Multi-Angles](https://huggingface.co/dx8152/Qwen-Edit-2509-Multiple-angles) | 72 (8 az x 3 el x 3 dist) | Bilingual text prompts |
| **poses_prompt** | Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Lightning | 16 poses | Prompt-driven body pose variations |
| **expressions** | Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Lightning | 16 emotions | Prompt-driven facial expression editing |
| **lighting** | Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Lightning | 4 variations | Prompt-driven lighting changes |
| **outfits** | Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Lightning | 4 variations | Prompt-driven outfit changes |
| **anypose** | [lilylilith/AnyPose](https://huggingface.co/lilylilith/AnyPose) | Per pose image | Pose transfer from reference images |
| **`--get-pose`** | [DWPose](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux) | Per render | Inline skeleton extraction (body, face, hands) — combines with any pipeline above |

### Multi-Angle Grid (2511 / 2509)

- **Azimuths** (8): 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees
- **Elevations** (4 for 2511, 3 for 2509): -30, 0, 30, 60 degrees
- **Distances** (3): 0.6 (close-up), 1.0 (medium), 1.8 (wide)

![Multi-angle example output](examples/angles_4x4.jpg)

### Skeleton Extraction (`--get-pose`)

When `--get-pose` is enabled, each rendered image is automatically run through DWPose extraction inline — no separate pass needed. Outputs include the skeleton visualization and a JSON file with all keypoints (body, face, hands).

![Skeleton extraction example](examples/skeletons_4x4.jpg)

Skeleton and JSON files are saved to a `poses/` subdirectory:

```
output_dir/
  az000_el+00_d1.0_front_view_eyelevel_shot_medium_shot.png
  poses/
    az000_el+00_d1.0_front_view_eyelevel_shot_medium_shot_skeleton.png
    az000_el+00_d1.0_front_view_eyelevel_shot_medium_shot_pose.json
```

The JSON contains OpenPose-format keypoints (18 body, 68 face, 21 per hand) which can be used for 3D triangulation, pose-driven generation, or ControlNet conditioning.

### Prompt Poses

Generates 16 body pose variations using text prompts only (no pose reference images needed). Each prompt describes specific limb positions, body angles, and activities.

![Prompt poses example output](examples/poses_prompt_4x4.jpg)

### Expressions

Generates 16 facial expression variations from a single image using Qwen Image Edit 2511 with prompt-driven editing. Expressions include body language cues that carry the emotion. Included expressions: neutral, happy, laughing, smirk, sad, crying, angry, disgusted, surprised, fearful, confused, determined, flirty, contempt, embarrassed, sleepy.

![Expressions example output](examples/expressions_4x4.jpg)

### Lighting

Renders the character under different lighting conditions while preserving identity and pose.

![Lighting example output](examples/lighting_1x4.jpg)

### Outfits

Renders the character in different outfits while preserving identity and pose.

![Outfits example output](examples/outfits_1x4.jpg)

### AnyPose

Transfers poses from reference images (OpenPose skeletons, photos, etc.) onto your subject using the [lilylilith/AnyPose](https://huggingface.co/lilylilith/AnyPose) LoRA. Pose images are automatically padded to square and background-matched to the reference image before upload.

![AnyPose example output](examples/poses_4x4.jpg)

### Customizing Lighting & Outfit Prompts

The `lighting` and `outfits` pipelines ship with default prompts designed for the example character (a young girl in a peace sign t-shirt). **You should customize these prompts for your own character.** A soldier, a robot, or a fantasy elf would each need different outfit and lighting descriptions.

Edit the `LIGHTING` and `OUTFITS` dictionaries in `batch_multi_angle.py`:

```python
LIGHTING = {
    "rim_light":     "Change the lighting so a bright light source is ...",
    "side_light":    "Change the lighting to strong directional side lighting ...",
    "golden_hour":   "Change the lighting to warm golden hour sunlight ...",
    "moonlight":     "Change the lighting to cool blue moonlight ...",
}

OUTFITS = {
    "formal":        "Change the outfit to ...",
    "athletic":      "Change the outfit to ...",
    "winter":        "Change the outfit to ...",
    "work":          "Change the outfit to ...",
}
```

Add or remove entries as needed — the script will automatically generate one image per entry. Use `--dry-run` to preview all prompts before rendering.

## Presentation Template

Generate a PowerPoint presentation template to start from.

```bash
python make_presentation.py --image ref.png --name "Nora" \
  --desc "A curious 10-year-old adventurer" \
  --output-dir ./pose_full_output
```

Produces a 16:9 PPTX with:
- **Title slide** — A-pose reference with character name and description
- **Multi-angle views** — 8 selected camera angles
- **Skeleton analysis** — Renders paired with DWPose extractions
- **Poses** — 8 prompt-driven body pose variations (if available)
- **Expressions** — 8 facial expression variations (if available)
- **Outfits & Lighting** — Outfit and lighting variations side by side (if available)

![Presentation template](examples/presentation_3x2.jpg)

The script auto-discovers expression, outfit, lighting, and pose images from sibling output directories. You can also specify them explicitly with `--expressions-dir`, `--outfits-dir`, `--lighting-dir`, and `--poses-dir`.

## Included Pose Images

The `poses/` directory contains OpenPose skeleton images from [Pose Depot](https://github.com/pose-depot/pose-depot):

- `poses/F/` — 61 female pose variations
- `poses/M/` — 61 male pose variations

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export COMFY_CLOUD_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # from https://cloud.comfy.org
```

The required models and LoRAs must be available in your Comfy Cloud workspace.

## Quick Start

Run everything — all angles, expressions, outfits, lighting, skeleton extraction, and presentation — with a single command:

```bash
python generate_character_sheet.py --image photo.png --name "Nora" --desc "A curious adventurer"
```

This produces a complete output directory with all passes and a PowerPoint template:

```
charsheet_nora/
  angles/                    # 96 multi-angle renders + poses/
  expressions/               # 16 facial expression variations
  outfits/                   # 4 outfit variations
  lighting/                  # 4 lighting variations
  angles/nora_character_sheet.pptx
```

Skip specific passes if you don't need them:

```bash
python generate_character_sheet.py --image photo.png --name "Nora" --skip outfits lighting
```

## Individual Pipelines

Each pass can also be run independently with `batch_multi_angle.py`:

```bash
# Multi-angle: 2511 pipeline (default, 96 poses)
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud

# Multi-angle: 2509 pipeline (72 poses)
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline 2509

# AnyPose: transfer poses from a directory of pose images
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline anypose --pose-dir ./poses/F

# Prompt poses: generate 16 body pose variations
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline poses_prompt

# Expressions: generate 16 facial expression variations
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline expressions

# Lighting: render under different lighting conditions
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline lighting

# Outfits: render in different outfits
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --pipeline outfits

# Different seed (output dir auto-named by pipeline + seed)
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --seed 123

# Append text to every prompt
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --prompt-append "dramatic lighting"

# Multi-angle with skeleton extraction
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --get-pose

# Render a subset of angles
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --azimuths 0,90,180,270 --elevations 0

# Preview all prompts without rendering
python batch_multi_angle.py --image photo.png --cloud --dry-run
```

## Output

Images are saved with descriptive filenames:

```
# Multi-angle
az000_el+00_d1.0_front_view_eyelevel_shot_medium_shot.png
az090_el-30_d0.6_right_side_view_lowangle_shot_closeup.png

# AnyPose
pose_2F_Hand_on_Hip_OpenPoseFull.png
pose_15F_Flying_Superhero_OpenPoseFull_3.png

# Expressions
expr_happy.png
expr_surprised.png

# Lighting / Outfits
light_rim_light.png
outfit_work.png
```

Existing files are automatically skipped, so you can safely re-run to fill in any gaps.

## How It Works

1. Uploads the input image to Comfy Cloud
2. For AnyPose: detects reference background color, pre-processes pose images (background match + square padding)
3. Connects a WebSocket to receive real-time execution results
4. Submits all workflows with concurrency control
5. Downloads completed renders as they finish via WebSocket output events

# 3D Rig Generation

Generate a rigged 3D mesh from a single character image using [SAM 3D Body](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body) running on [Modal](https://modal.com). The pipeline extracts a full SMPL body mesh with 3D joint positions, skeleton hierarchy, and skin weights, then exports to standard interchange formats (FBX, glTF, OBJ) for import into any DCC tool.

![Pose to 3D rig](examples/pose_to_rig.png)

## Step 1: Extract 3D body from image

```bash
cd sam3d_pipeline
modal run run_sam3body.py --image-path /path/to/front_eyelevel.png
```

This runs SAM 3D Body inference on a GPU (A10G) via Modal and saves:
- `sam3body_result.json` — 3D keypoints and joint coordinates
- `exports/character_mesh.glb` — body mesh (GLB format)
- `exports/character_mesh.obj` — body mesh (OBJ format)
- `exports/character_full_data.json` — full data with vertices, faces, skeleton hierarchy, and skin weights

## Step 2: Build rig and export

A sample import script (`blender_import_rig.py`) is included that reads `exports/character_full_data.json` and creates:
- Mesh with correct topology
- 127-joint skeleton hierarchy
- Vertex groups with skin weights
- Exports as FBX and glTF

The exported FBX/glTF files can be loaded into any DCC application.
